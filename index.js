 * Seek and Sync is tool for managing development between two independent 
 * projects. The tool is meant to be structure agnostic, where two development 
 * teams can manage their own workflows. The primary use case is when one 
 * project is a subset, and the development workflow of the project is separate 
 * than that of the parent project.
